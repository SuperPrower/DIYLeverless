# Matchstick Box (aka Woodbox)

<img src="pictures/woodbox.jpg" width="600">

The goal of the project was to make a controller that would be more comfortable for people with wider shoulders through split layout (movement buttons and attack buttons separated). Additionally, it was supposed to prevent Ulnar Deviation / wrist angling by slightly tilting each button block inwards. Bigger size also helps with more comfort when placed on the knees, which is something I would typically have to do at locals.

The initial sketches for button layouts were fitting roughly on the A4 sheet of paper. As such, I opted to purchase a hobby wooden box that could fit an A4 sheet inside.

I used a laser cutter at my local hackspace to cut the lid of the box and a sheet of acrylic to go on top of it.
