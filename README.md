# SuperPrower's notes on DIY Leverless controllers

This repository contains my notes, pictures, and CAD files of the leverless controllers I have built or attempted to build.

Rather than being a blueprint for a projects, it should be used as a reference, inspiration or a list of mistakes to avoid. DIY mindset required.

Notes range from my philosophy when approaching something to my experience and advice based on it.

Repository structure:
- `flatbox`: contains the notes on my first controller, based on the [flatbox](https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox) rev4 - TBA.
- `woodbox`: my most recent controller, built out of generic wooden box for storage.

The "Homework" sections contain mistakes I've made and things I would do differently in the future. If one is present, please read it if you're trying to replicate or be inspired by some of the ideas.
